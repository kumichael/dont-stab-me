Don't STAB Me! - A jQuery Game

============


Hello and welcome to Don't Stab Me! 
Originally intended for use as a satirical crime-rate statistics website, "Don't Stab Me!" turned into a (much smaller-scale) weekend web project.

In this luck-based game, you play as the world's worst assassin. With a 0% hit rate, you have failed every assassination mission you have received to date. Your goal is not to stab the correct target, but instead, accidentally stab everyone else.
